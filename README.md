# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

The Tic-Tac-Toe game is the first project assigned to students in General
Assembly's Web Development Immersive (WDI) course.  The student is tasked with
using material learned in class during the first two weeks to create and deploy
a web application to log in using auhtenticated credentials and participate in
playing Tic-Tac-Toe games alternating between Player "X" and Player "O".
